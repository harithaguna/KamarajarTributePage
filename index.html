            <h3 id="#earlylife">Early Life:</h3>
            <p>Kumaraswamy Kamaraj was born on 15th July, 1903 in Virudhunagar in Tamil Nadu. He only attended school until the age of 11 due to financial constraints. Both the Indian National Congress and Mahatma Gandhi were major influences in Kamaraj's life from a young age.</p>
            <h3 id="Freedom">Role in Indiaâ€™s Independence Movement:</h3>
            <p>
                Kamaraj was a vocal activist against the British Raj, who was inspired to join the freedom struggle by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. His participation in the Salt Satyagraha resulted in the first of several imprisonments. He also participated in the Nagpur flag Satyagraha, and led the Sword Satyagraha and the Neil Statue Satyagraha. In 1942, he was jailed for three years for his involvement in the Quit India Movement.
